Unsupervised Learning Analysis
Steps and Requirements

1. Data Acquisition
   - Find a publicly available dataset from sources like the UCI Machine Learning Repository or any other platform that utilizes unsupervised learning tasks (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection, clustering).
   - Explain your choice of the dataset and how it is suitable for unsupervised learning.

2. Data Cleaning
   - Load the dataset into your environment (e.g., Python with Pandas).
   - Identify and handle missing values. Discuss your approach (removal, imputation, etc.).
   - Identify and remove any duplicate entries, if present.
   - Correct any data type inconsistencies (e.g., ensuring numerical types are recognized correctly).
   - Provide a summary of your data after cleaning it (e.g., using the `.describe()` function).

3. Feature Engineering
   - Create at least three new features that could potentially improve model performance. Explain the rationale behind the creation of each feature.
   - Consider interactions or transformations (e.g., normalization, dimensionality reduction, encoding).

4. Data Visualization
   - Create at least five visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Ensure they help in understanding the dataset:
     - Distribution of features.
     - Heatmap of feature correlations.
     - Pairwise relationships between features.
     - Box plots to identify outliers.
     - Cluster visualization (e.g., using t-SNE or PCA for dimensionality reduction).
   - Provide interpretations of each visualization.

5. Unsupervised Learning Modeling
   - Implement at least 4 different unsupervised learning models
   - For each model, perform the following:
     - Train the model on the dataset.
     - Visualize the results of the model (e.g., cluster assignments, principal components).
     - Evaluate the model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, explained variance ratio for PCA).
     - Compare the results of each model and discuss which model performed the best and why.

6. Report
   - Ensure your notebook is well documented, including:
     - An introduction to the problem and dataset.
     - Details of your data cleaning process.
     - Descriptions of engineered features.
     - Visualizations with interpretations.
     - A summary of the unsupervised learning models used, results obtained, and insights drawn.
   - Your report should be well-structured, with clear headings and explanations.
